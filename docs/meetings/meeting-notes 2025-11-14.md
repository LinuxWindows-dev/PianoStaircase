- **HYDRO-POWRE**: install a large water tank at the top of the Russ Atrium and use gravity to make water go down.
	- This is the *real* reason we have a water level sensor.
	- Totally safe.  There's no risks at all.
	- How do we fill the water tank?  Where does the water go after we're done?  This is outside our scope.  Future problems for *other* people.
	 - **This gives the mechanical engineers something useful to do.**
	 - **Alternative: *RBMK NUCLEAR POWER PLANT***
 - **Microcontroller**:
	 - Raspberry Pi Zero
		 - Pros:
			 - Full OS
			 - REAL sound playback: SCREAMING GOATS
			 - Affordable
		 - Cons:
			 - No analog pins
			 - Full OS will use most of the RAM
	 - Raspberry Pi Pico Salsa
		 - Pros:
			 - Very cheap
			 - Like an Arduino Uno but not Arduino Uno
			 - Probably does analog inputs
		 - Cons:
			 - Not a full OS
			 - No *real* sound playback
			 - Might actually run Matlab (not really)
			 - Limited processing powre
			 - Very limited sound playback
	 - Arduino Uno
		 - Pros:
			 - Well supported
			 - Easy to work with
			 - Affordable
			 - Analog Inputs
		 - Cons:
			 - No OS
			 - Airaehbehbellax will try to run Matlab on the Arduino Uno.
				 - Actually, this is a pro.  I *need* to see this.  
			 - Limited processing power
			 - Very limited sound generation
				 - Pro: this would sound horrible
				 - Con: no screaming goat sounds
	 - ESP32
		 - Pros:
			 - Nobody knows how to use this.
			 - WiFi/BT, so we can flood the atrium with 44 WiFi signals
		 - Cons:
			 - Nobody knows how to use this.
	 - Raspberry Pi 4
		 - Pros:
			 - Full featured SOC
			 - Several on shelf
			 - Plenty of RAM, processing
			 - Might actually run Matlab (for realsy)
		 - Cons:
			 - Expensive
			 - Big
			 - No Analog pins
 - **Sensors**:
	 - Ultrasonic
		 - Pros:
			 - Full length of stair
			 - Affordable
		 - Cons:
			 - Requires analog input
			 - Crosstalk is real.  We'd need to syncronize the sensors somehow to prevent this.
	 - ToF
		 - Pros:
			 - Digital input
			 - Does not reach full length of step
				 - This means people can choose to not sound cool going up the steps.
		 - Cons:
			 - More expensive
			 - Does not reach full length of step
	 - Infrared Trip
		 - Pros:
			 - Cheap
		 - Cons:
			 - Limited range
			 - Requires two sensors on two sides
			 - Possible interference from irritable sunlight
	 - Trip Wire
		 - Pros:
			 - Fewer Engineering Students
				 - Less competition for future jobs.
				 - Less people in the world.
			 - Easy to implement!
			 - People make sounds when they trip.
				 - COLA vocal students are better for this.  This was Airaehbehbellax's idea.
				 - Or Business Students.  This was Andrew's idea.
		 - Cons:
			 - Fewer Engineering Students
				 - Someone has to give money to the university.
 - *Octopi, Cuttlefish, Squid all have multiple hearts.*
 - *SOME EEs are crazy people who like Integrals.*
 - **We had genuine, productive, ongoing discussion of crayon consuption.**
	 - Pros:
		- Discussion on favorite colors to eat
	 - Cons:
		 - We don't have any crayons
- *Airaehbehbellax suggested cutting the cable on the elevator in order to force CS students to take the stairs.*
	- Ien started this conversation by suggesting only CS students don't take the stairs.
	- This helps our future doctors find motivation and income.
	- Airaehbehbellax also recommended adding cracking sound playback in the elevator.  And ghost sounds.
- **Why did we start discussing burying people alive and pretend we're not serial killers?**
- **Let's have kids so we have organ donors.**  *This is our source of funding.*  Airaehbehbellax said this.
