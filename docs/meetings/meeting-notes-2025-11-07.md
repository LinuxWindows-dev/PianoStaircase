# Meeting Notes October 31st, 2025

## Discussion

- Needed range: 67 inches (1.7018 meters)

**Pi's:**
- Pi 0: 5 volt limitation (without work around)
- Pi 4: bigger (heat issues), more expensive (dont have the budget for each step to have a Pi 4)

**Sensors we have in house:**

- Ultrasonic
  - Con: Interference issues, doesn't work with 0
  - Pro: Plenty of range

- Analog distance Sensor
  - Con: Needs an ADC (analog digital converter)
  - Pro: Enough range (barely)

- Time of flight 
  - Con: Slightly more expensive, not enough range
  - Pro: N/A not enough range to consider (works with Pi 0)

- Beam break sensor
  - Con: Not enough range
  - Pro: N/A not enough range to consider

- IR Trip Sensor
  - Con: Not nearly enough range
  - Pro: N/A not enough range to consider

- Infrared-red trig
  - Con: Not enough range, also analog
  - Pro: N/A not enough range to consider

**Not in house:**

- Radar/microwave sensors
  - Con: Requires to much power
  - Pro: Enough range

- Garage door sensor
  - Con: High voltage requirements (works with power workaround)
  - Pro: Enough range

## Key Decisions
- Learned we do not have the supplies in house to make a working prototype
